__Skills Demonstrated in the Weather API Project__


__🔌 API Integration__

Used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data based on user input.

Handled HTTP requests and responses using the requests library.

Demonstrated knowledge of API key handling and secure API usage practices.


__🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)__

Designed a City class to encapsulate city-specific attributes and behavior.

Used constructors (__init__) and instance methods for clean, modular code.

Promoted code reusability and scalability using OOP principles.


__🧾 JSON Parsing and Data Handling__

Parsed complex JSON structures returned by the API using the json module.

Extracted and displayed relevant weather metrics like temperature, highs, and lows.


__📥 User Input Validation__

Enabled dynamic user interaction through command-line inputs for city name or coordinates.

Included options to choose between metric and imperial units, improving UX.


__🖥️ Console Application Design__

Created a user-friendly CLI with clear, readable output using formatted strings (f-strings).

Displayed location-specific weather summaries for different cities.


__🛠️ Debugging and Testing Mindset__

Handled edge cases and potential API errors (e.g., invalid input, missing data).

Built logic to test with multiple cities like London and Malaga, aiding in functional verification.
